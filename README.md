Integrative Causal Gene Identification

![artwork.jpeg](artwork.jpeg)
An Interesting Attempt: Using GPT-4o to generate illustrations of cancer gene identification. It is undeniable that the LLM possesses versatile and powerful capabilities, and LLM-aided strategies holds great promise for addressing complex scientific challenges.

This is the official implementation of the paper "Cancer Gene Identification through Integrating Causal Prompting Large Language Model with Omics Data-Driven Causal Inference". The code will come soon.

ðŸš€ Key points:

- The study introduces a novel framework ICGI for cancer gene identification which exploits the emergent capabilities of the LLM and the advantages of causal inference.

- ICGI exhibits superior performance in identifying cancer genes from multi-omics information, distinguishing between cancer and normal samples, and explaining biological mechanisms.

- The study offers valuable insights into unlocking the potential of LLM for bioinformatics tasks through CoT prompting and the RAG technique. This LLM-aided strategy holds great promise for addressing other complex scientific challenges as well.

- A web application has been developed and deployed to facilitate the ease of using the new tool produced by this research.
